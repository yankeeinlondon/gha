## Reusable Workflows

### JS/TS Centric

1. `test`
    - runs **unit tests** in a repository which has a "test" script in the `package.json`
    - runs **linter** in a repository which has a "lint" script in the `package.json`
2. `publish` - releases to NPM if the appropriate conditions are met

### Rust Centric

- TBD
