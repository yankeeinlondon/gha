For example, if you had an action that performed the addition of two inputs (x + y = z), the action could output the sum (z) for other actions to use as an input.\nIf you don't declare an output in your action metadata file, you can still set outputs and use them in a workflow.","type":"object","patternProperties":{"^[_a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$":{"$comment":"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#outputsoutput_id","description":"A string identifier to associate with the output.
