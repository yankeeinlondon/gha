Most GitHub events are triggered by more than one type of activity. For example, the event for the release resource is triggered when a release is published, unpublished, created, edited, deleted, or prereleased. The types keyword enables you to narrow down activity that causes the workflow to run. When only one activity type triggers a webhook event, the types keyword is unnecessary.\nYou can use an array of event types. For more information about each event and their activity types, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#webhook-events.","oneOf":[{"type":"array","minItems":1},{"type":"string"}]}
